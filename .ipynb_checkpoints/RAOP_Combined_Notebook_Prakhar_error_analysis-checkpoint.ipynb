       "      <td>I'm going to keep this as short, but still have it make sense, as possible.\\nI intended on moving to Pennsylvania from Nevada into my grandfathers house, was stated before I left that I'd already have a job at a local grocery store, and that everything was set for me to get there.\\n\\nSo I drive 2700 miles cross country in a car that shouldn't have made it, I spend practically all of my money in doing this.\\nI get there and everything is fine for about a day.\\nHe decides that I cannot stay at the house when he's gone (I am almost 22), so two or three days after I get there, he has a funeral he has to be at, and me not comfortable going to a funeral of someone I didn't know, don't go. I drive around and drive by a little later and no ones there, so i get out of my car and say fuck it and lay in the front yard, get bored and leave again, 30 minutes later he's back and everythings fine.\\n\\nThe next morning he wakes me up at 10 asking me if I'm going to sleep all day, proceeds trying to get into an argument with me saying i tried to break into his house the day before while he's gone, accusing me of unlocking all his windows and says he knows I tried to break in because he has someone following me around taking pictures. Screaming at me that I'm a liar when I did nothing wrong, and he wants me to leave. So I gather all my shit up and call my uncle. He says I can stay in a run down trailer behind his friends house. \\n\\nI'm 2700 miles away from anything or anyone I know staying in a run down trailer, with no money because I spent $300 driving across country, no job because I was lied to, and looking at selling my car to get back home. My uncles broke and can't help me, the people I'm staying at frequently eat out. I have no cash, my cars out of gas, and it basically feels like no one gives a shit. I came trusting my grandfather was trying to help me, and all he did was displace me, break me, lie to me, and insult me. \\n\\nI'd just like something to get me through until I get the documents so I can scrap my car to a salvage company ( that I paid 1K for before I left) so I can get a bus ticket back to Nevada. Which should be monday or tuesday depending on how fast my mom gets to the DMV. And before you ask my mom is unemployed and unable to help.\\nI don't like asking people for help but I love helping others. This will definitely be paid forward as soon as I can.\\nI'm in the eastern PA area. \\nThanks for any help any one can give, it won't be forgotten and will definitely be paid forward.\\n\\nTL;DR Moved out to PA from NV, was told I had a job, didn't, grandfather went all schizo on me, now I'm staying in a run down trailer behind my uncles friends house, waiting for the paper work for my car so I can scrap it and go back home.\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/Hah9o</td>\n",

A couple months ago our roof decided to start leaking, right in to our bedroom. Insurance isn't covering it because the roof is old. We are trying to save to repair the roof and replace the drywall that was damaged. Since that time, things have continued to spiral downward. I don't want to be long winded, but it has gone so far that we have had to apply for foodstamps and medicaid because I have 2 have surgery and a diagnostic procedure to rule out cervical cancer. My husband's wages have been cut because the runs just aren't there. We are struggling and the only way that we have had any food for the past couple of weeks is because of my parents. I have been looking for a job, but I have had no success. We are even having to sell our electronics on craigslist to try and get some money to survive. It has been very stressful and frustrating for us and I know our kids can tell that something is wrong. I was hoping that someone might be willing to give us just one bright spot in this dark time.

       "274  I've been near broke since late May and for the past 2 weeks I've been scraping by on my loose change while I wait for the first paycheck from a new job. I was told I would be receiving direct deposit by midnight of last night and I woke up this morning to... nothing. Lately I've been eating rice, .50 loaves of day old Jimmy Johns bread, and $2 lunch specials from this really great Thai restaurant nearby. But those can get pretty tiring after repetition.  \\n\\nI have just enough change to take the CTA to and from work for today and tomorrow and if don't get my money by then, well fuck, that's my own problem. I have $5.90 left in my bank account, which I'm keeping there as a kind of emergency buffer.

       "87   Hello, I've been a longtime lurker on reddit and finally made an account a few weeks back.. since then my life has absolutely been turned upside down. \\n\\nAfter this semester [full time] at university I lost my job. I had barely paid off this semester via payment plan when I received the VOICEMAIL informing me I was no longer needed at work. \\n\\nThe issues created by not having money for my bills and gas caused major problems with my parents, who had been letting me live at home this last semester on the condition I would finish my degree and sustain myself financially regarding everything but the roof over my head. Needless to say, they do not really have the means to support another person and I left because of this strain.\\n\\nI have been couch crashing this last week at a friends' with literally nothing to offer him (or his awesome, understanding roommates who I really just met) in return for their hospitality. A PIZZA!! =) to share with these great people would not only be the first whole meal I have had for a while, but it would go a long way towards making me feel a bit better about myself for actually contributing to this house a bit. The other folks here are all struggling students, and looking in the pantry all I'm seeing is ramen and potatoes (lol). \\n\\nThanks for putting up with this wall of text, I felt obligated to give the whole story! Not sure of what evidence is necessary but needless to say if you ask for it I will provide. I hope I did this right (got a confirmation code as well if needed) but here goes heh.

And I WILL pay it forward this summer when I have more money again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "255  I'm an Engineering student, not a Performing Arts student, so I can't make up a compelling back story for why I want a pizza.  I'm hungry, I have no money after Black Friday and something greasy and cheesy sounds awesome right now.  Im not in dire straights to feed my starving children ( I have no children I'm only 22) nor have I been fasting on Taco Bell hot sauce for the past week, I just really want a pizza.  If someone feels like helping me out that would be awesome and after I get my internship over the winter season I promise to pay it forward to someone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "383  There is a Papa Johns right near us and I have a 50% off code if you'd like to use it. I looked and the total for the Pizza we would like would end up being $11.66 with the coupon.\\n\\nMore Info:  I started a new job on Friday and we get paid every other week, starting next week (so I'll only get paid for one day on my first paycheck on 9/7).  We have about $1080 in our checking account and rent ($1050) comes out within the next couple of days.  Husband won't get paid again until 9/14.  \\n\\nAs for proof, I can take a screenshot of our bank account balance and a couple of past rent deductions from the account so you can see the amount and them coming out the first of the month.

       "191  I'm going to keep this as short, but still have it make sense, as possible.\\nI intended on moving to Pennsylvania from Nevada into my grandfathers house, was stated before I left that I'd already have a job at a local grocery store, and that everything was set for me to get there.\\n\\nSo I drive 2700 miles cross country in a car that shouldn't have made it, I spend practically all of my money in doing this.\\nI get there and everything is fine for about a day.\\nHe decides that I cannot stay at the house when he's gone (I am almost 22), so two or three days after I get there, he has a funeral he has to be at, and me not comfortable going to a funeral of someone I didn't know, don't go. I drive around and drive by a little later and no ones there, so i get out of my car and say fuck it and lay in the front yard, get bored and leave again, 30 minutes later he's back and everythings fine.\\n\\nThe next morning he wakes me up at 10 asking me if I'm going to sleep all day, proceeds trying to get into an argument with me saying i tried to break into his house the day before while he's gone, accusing me of unlocking all his windows and says he knows I tried to break in because he has someone following me around taking pictures. Screaming at me that I'm a liar when I did nothing wrong, and he wants me to leave. So I gather all my shit up and call my uncle. He says I can stay in a run down trailer behind his friends house. \\n\\nI'm 2700 miles away from anything or anyone I know staying in a run down trailer, with no money because I spent $300 driving across country, no job because I was lied to, and looking at selling my car to get back home. My uncles broke and can't help me, the people I'm staying at frequently eat out. I have no cash, my cars out of gas, and it basically feels like no one gives a shit. I came trusting my grandfather was trying to help me, and all he did was displace me, break me, lie to me, and insult me. \\n\\nI'd just like something to get me through until I get the documents so I can scrap my car to a salvage company ( that I paid 1K for before I left) so I can get a bus ticket back to Nevada. Which should be monday or tuesday depending on how fast my mom gets to the DMV. And before you ask my mom is unemployed and unable to help.\\nI don't like asking people for help but I love helping others. This will definitely be paid forward as soon as I can.\\nI'm in the eastern PA area. \\nThanks for any help any one can give, it won't be forgotten and will definitely be paid forward.\\n\\nTL;DR Moved out to PA from NV, was told I had a job, didn't, grandfather went all schizo on me, now I'm staying in a run down trailer behind my uncles friends house, waiting for the paper work for my car so I can scrap it and go back home.\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/Hah9o   \n",
       "102  I have been suffering from pretty bad depression and social anxiety over the past 6 months. Ended up dropping out of my last semester of university and quit my job during this time. I just maxed out my credit card on a new prescription, and I am out of even credit now. The bottom line is I have no money to buy any food right now and only have a few cans of beans left. I would love to have a nice hot pizza to get me through the next few days. I am hoping this newest prescription works how it should and I am able to get out and find a job because I would love to play it forward and help out a fellow Redditor in need. I verified my email and also have another account which has a bunch of karma, I just have a few friends on that account and would be too embarrassed for them to find out about my current situation. Thanks in advance for anyone that has taken the time to read this and hope someone can help out. \\n\\nSome of the local pizza places are Pizza Pizza, Ginos Pizza, Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza. Pizza Pizza being the closest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "270  I went out friday night for Star Trek trivia (which I lost) and I must have lost my debit card somewhere from the trivia event to my house.  I didn't leave the house at all yesterday as I had no need to since I had enough food to make myself dinner Saturday night when the intention of going grocery shopping today...however My Debit card is gone.  I've searched everywhere and it's gone.  This wouldn't be bad if my bank were open on a sunday but alas it is not.  Since I have nothing to eat today I figured I've give it a shot and ask another redditor for some help .  I can pay you back or pay it forward as early as tomorrow as soon as I can get to a bank and get a new card.\\n\\nThanks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "300  Hi... I am new to this, so I hope I am doing it right. I live in central FL. My husband and I have 3 young children. My husband is a local truck driver and I am a stay-at-home mom. A couple months ago our roof decided to start leaking, right in to our bedroom. Insurance isn't covering it because the roof is old. We are trying to save to repair the roof and replace the drywall that was damaged. Since that time, things have continued to spiral downward. I don't want to be long winded, but it has gone so far that we have had to apply for foodstamps and medicaid because I have 2 have surgery and a diagnostic procedure to rule out cervical cancer. My husband's wages have been cut because the runs just aren't there. We are struggling and the only way that we have had any food for the past couple of weeks is because of my parents. I have been looking for a job, but I have had no success. We are even having to sell our electronics on craigslist to try and get some money to survive. It has been very stressful and frustrating for us and I know our kids can tell that something is wrong. I was hoping that someone might be willing to give us just one bright spot in this dark time. Thanks for taking the time to read all of this. Blessings to you all. :0)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "351  So I'm pretty broke this month and just heard from work that I wont be needed for a few weeks meaning that I don't have any money coming in for a while. I heard this after getting back from a full day in uni and with a few hours of reading to do tonight so I would really appreciate some pizza. In return I will pay the favour forward when I get money again and send the redditor who makes me smile a story of some kind or photos of me looking happy :) please help me random knights of the internet.\\n\\nEDIT: location is uk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "92   Well, it's Thursday and I am hungry. We get paid on the 15th of every month at my job, and when I looked when I paid all my bills for the first half of the month, I thought the 15th was a Sunday which means we would have got our paychecks tomorrow (Friday since they do not direct deposit on the weekend).\\n\\nThe first half of the month always kills me in bills so I know to be tight with money until I get paid next...well, I didn't expect to not have any money all weekend. Whoops. It is totally my fault though, since I totally looked at the wrong date. Derp.\\n\\nAnyways, just looking for some dinner tonight that will last over into breakfast/lunch tomorrow, but I am not poor or needy by any stretch of the imagination, **SO THAT MEANS THAT IF THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE POSTING THAT SOUNDS AS IF THEY NEED THIS PIZZA WAY MORE THAN ME, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF CHEESE GIVE IT TO THEM OVER ME!**\\n\\nI just want to get a pizza today and pay for it once I get paid, so that means if you buy me a pizza, come Monday you can (read: **YOU GOTTA DO IT MAN**) PM me saying *Hey, I bought you that pizza on Thursday, I want my pizza back now bitch.\"* and you'll have a pizza sent right to your door!\\n\\nOr, if you're feeling x2 times as generous, email me a link from RAoP that you chose and feel is needing a pizza, and I'll randomly send them a pizza. Pretty much, I feel shitty asking for a pizza tonight because it is just piss poor planning on my part with my pay, so I'd love to just give the pizza back to you next week or give it to someone else you deem is worthy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "369  Hanging out, alone in my apartment with my cats, and if I eat ramen noodles one more time I might throw up. Would appreciate something real to eat.

Just got my electricity turned back on since I have a deadbeat roommate...\\nI'll pay it forward as soon as I can.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

Good, here's the back story.\\n\\nWe have no food left for tonight, we're pretty much stuck until tomorrow without any sort of consumables. Yeah, sounds like a fun night, right? Not really? Well, maybe you can be the individual that solves this issue. That's right! For just ONE EASY PAYMENT, you could rest more easily tonight knowing that you helped out a group of four rather hungry individuals, granting them the sustenance to last until tomorrow. \\n\\n***This document translated from a received email.***\\n\\nOriginal message is as follows:\\nHELLO GOOD FRIEND MY NAME IS RAY ABU BIN AL-AKAY I AM WRITING YOU TODAY BECAUSE THE NEWS HAS BEEN BROKEN TO ME THAT SOMEONE DIRECTLY UPON YOUR LINEAGE HAS PASSED AWAY AND NAMED ME AS EXECUTOR OF THEIR WILL; ONE OF THE STIPULATIONS IS THAT YOU WILL WORK WITH ME IN ORDER TO MOVE THEIR MASSIVE FORTUNE OF 23.000.000,00 USD; AS A PROOF OF GOOD FAITH, I REQUIRE A SIMPLE ACT ON YOUR FORM, SOMETHING THAT ANY FELLOW OF GOD IN GOOD STANDING MAY PERFORM: PLEASE PROVIDE MYSELF AND MY ASSOCIATES PIZZA SO THAT WE MAY HAVE FUEL WITH WHICH TO NURTURE OURSELVES AND SUSTAIN UNTIL THE MORNING THAT WE MAY DRAFT UP PAPERWORK AND BEGIN TRANSFER IMMEDIATELY REGARDS RAY ABU BIN AL-AKAY ESQUIRE\\n\\n(you should really turn your spam filter on btw)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "74   I just paid the last of my bills, and now have 3 dollars in my wallet. I wont be getting any more money for at least 5 more days, and currently have 2 packets of mac and cheese to eat. Not exactly sure what I'm going to do, my stomach is really starting to hurt from not eating. I feel pretty weird asking for food like this but I love this whole operation. I'd promise to pay it forward soon as I am able!\\n\\nI'm in Westwood, CA...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "227  My fiance and I just moved to AK to spend time with his grandfather who is doing poorly and return to where he grew up. In doing so we have a grand total of 1.55 cents in change and would love to have something substantial to eat other then the few packs of ramen we have to live off of for a month which is worse then the food rationing we have to do with the pets the poor things. We would love a pizza miracle in our home! Next month when we have money we will pay it forward to another desperate soul &lt;3\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/a/51gOA\\n\\nThank you so much for the pizza 1n_my_opinion!!!

Card declined. Try again. Declined again. Insert sinking feeling here. Try once more as credit. No dice. So I left empty handed. Get home and check the bank account to see what has happened, because I had at least $20 to my name. Nope. I'm now negative almost $200 due to a payment I wasn't aware was hitting today.

It'd be great to receive a pizza - to be able to skip having to cook tonight since I'm still under the weather.\\n\\nAny help would be appreciated.  Promise!  :D  Thanks</td>\n",

For 4-5ish months(maybe alittle less) my fiance had been hit by a truck and was out of work for that long. She has been back to work for about 2 months so we've been just getting by on payments. We had to take a loan out to pay for car issues and since I haven't been able to find a job, our bills are being paid late every month until we can finish paying this loan off. It's been fairly depressing, and I can see it affecting her and our relationship quite a bit. I hurt my back not long ago and have been in PT getting it fixed up. \\nSo my job searching hasn't been the best, they thought I would have to have surgery, now were working on just getting it to be anon pinched nerve so I can actually move more. We don't argue about money/food a lot, but I know it is affecting her and making her stressed.. And it hurts me to see it.\\n\\nAnyways. In my fridge is milk and yogurt. Rice and frozen veggies is in the freezer(Rice in cabinet).. And we've basically been eating Ramen or rice for the past few weeks as we haven't gone shopping in a long time. It's her 2 days off starting today and if, out of the generosity of reddit users we could get 1 or 2 pizzas(2 would be optimum for left overs for the next dinner, but 1 is fine) I will gladly gift, post pictures, and even send you a thank you letter/upvote you for life.\\n\\nI have these:\\nHL2,HL2:ep1,Portal,Magicka:vietnam</td>\n",

Went to meet someone to sell an item and ended up turning back because they messaged that their car broke down. No big deal, stuff happens. Went to HEB to get some milk and bread, basic staple stuff. Card declined. Try again. Declined again. Insert sinking feeling here. Try once more as credit. No dice. So I left empty handed. Get home and check the bank account to see what has happened, because I had at least $20 to my name. Nope. I'm now negative almost $200 due to a payment I wasn't aware was hitting today. Fantastic.\\n\\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\\n\\nNow, I have food, it's just not anything special (ramen, pasta, rice). That said, I would much rather people more needy than I get pizza'd.

       "134  Last year, I had to kick my ex out (he was threatening me), and in order to support myself, I took on a second job.  During that time, I bought a pizza for someone who was struggling.  They never came back to thank me :(  But I still felt good :)\\n\\nEarly this year, I had to quit the second job - my doctor said the additional stress was causing hypertension, among other things.  Now, I'm struggling to pay all my bills.  I currently have less than a dollar in my checking account, and missed work yesterday due to illness.  It'd be great to receive a pizza - to be able to skip having to cook tonight since I'm still under the weather.\\n\\nAny help would be appreciated.

       "397  Hello! I was laid off about 3 months ago, and haven't been able to find a job since. For 4-5ish months(maybe alittle less) my fiance had been hit by a truck and was out of work for that long. She has been back to work for about 2 months so we've been just getting by on payments. We had to take a loan out to pay for car issues and since I haven't been able to find a job, our bills are being paid late every month until we can finish paying this loan off. It's been fairly depressing, and I can see it affecting her and our relationship quite a bit. I hurt my back not long ago and have been in PT getting it fixed up. \\nSo my job searching hasn't been the best, they thought I would have to have surgery, now were working on just getting it to be anon pinched nerve so I can actually move more. We don't argue about money/food a lot, but I know it is affecting her and making her stressed.. And it hurts me to see it.\\n\\nAnyways. In my fridge is milk and yogurt. Rice and frozen veggies is in the freezer(Rice in cabinet).. And we've basically been eating Ramen or rice for the past few weeks as we haven't gone shopping in a long time. It's her 2 days off starting today and if, out of the generosity of reddit users we could get 1 or 2 pizzas(2 would be optimum for left overs for the next dinner, but 1 is fine) I will gladly gift, post pictures, and even send you a thank you letter/upvote you for life.\\n\\nI have these:\\nHL2,HL2:ep1,Portal,Magicka:vietnam                                                                                                    \n",

Boyfriend and I find the perfect one and spend the last of our cash for the week to get it We. bring it over to surprise her with it and her controlling boyfriend says she can't have the dog because he didn't get her for it.

       "402  Money is incredibly tight right now as I just sent my son to Walt Disney World with his high school marching band for spring break (right around $1400).  Judging from the last surgery I had on my gastrointestinal system, it will be at least 10-12 months before I will be able to enjoy pizza without a fair amount of discomfort.  I might even come out of this totally lactose intolerant, which, holy Horatio Cain, would be a terrible, terrible blow.  \\n\\nI'd like to spend my last evening with solid food for the forseeable future the way anytrue blue redditor would: on the couch, consuming pizza while watching Archer and Lost on Netflix.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "83   We've been pretty responsible people, my Girlfriend and I.  We've worked hard, spent within our means, and have always been on time with all of our bills and rent.  It seems that last part may have gotten us in a bit of deep water.  After doing the right thing and scraping by, it has come.  My Girlfriend's student loans have kicked in.  This has been a bit of a culture shock to us, and in all honesty, we weren't prepared.  \\n\\nOur total amount of bills almost doubled because of this new one.  My girlfriend has been a bit stressed of late, as have I, because it's increasingly looking like one of us(if not both) is going to have to take on a second job, or the eviction fairy shall be making it's rounds.  We have enough food for maybe one meal, and the nearest payday is next week.  It would be a great stress reliever, and an overall solid evening if me and my girlfriend could share a Pizza tonight.  \\n\\nIt would be double the awesome, because her absolute favorite food is pizza, and seems skeptical of this entire community(Reddit all together, not just RAOP). If one of you fine Redditors could show us the way to pizza goodness, not only will you have the good karma, and satisfaction of helping a hard working college grad out, I'll also get my girlfriend to draw you a rad picture!  Win, Win in my book.  \\n\\nI'm located in NW Ohio, and at the moment we only have a Pizza Hut within the miles we have gas to make it too. Thank you in advance, and know, that I am in love with the RAOP community.  This is a true beacon of humanity.  Kudos!\\n\\n   \n",

       "302  Hey guys, Philly redditor here. I lost my job last week and I've been getting by with cups of noodles and tuna and rice for the past few days, I'd really appreciate a real meal. My roommate's gone this weekend so this would be able to feed me for the next couple days. \\n\\nI'm sure people frequently say \"Oooh get me pizza and I'll get you back sometime pinky promise\" and then never cash in on that promise. Well I won't lie. I'm pretty broke, and until August when new job starts, I can't promise I'll get you guys back. So no empty promises for now. But I can tell you guys I'm hungry and broke, and it would be amazing if any of you could help me. \\n\\nThank You                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
