    "The idea of PMI is that we want to quantify the likelihood of co-occurrence of two words, taking into account the fact that it might be caused by the frequency of the single words. Hence, the algorithm computes the (log) probability of co-occurrence scaled by the product of the single probability of occurrence as follows:\n",

    "PMI (a, b) = \\log(\\frac{P(a, b)}{P(a) * P(b)})\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, knowing that, when ‘a’ and ‘b’ are independent, their joint probability is equal to the product of their marginal probabilities, when the ratio equals 1 (hence the log equals 0), it means that the two words together don’t form a unique concept: they co-occur by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that we can use PMI criterion to not just detect the collocation of two words. We can also use it to get a sense of if a word and a class are co-occuring togather or not. This is the way we are going to use PMI in our case. "
